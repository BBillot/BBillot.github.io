I'm a postdoc at the Medical Vision Group led by Prof. Polina Golland. My research focuses on improving data 
representation to increase the robustness of systems for the analysis of clinical imaging data. 

After completing a MSc in neuro-technology at Imperial College London in 2016, I joined the incubator of start-ups 
[Founders Factory](https://foundersfactory.com/) as a member of the AI team. I then pursued a PhD at University College London with 
[Dr. Juan Eugenio Iglesias](http://www.jeiglesias.com) on developing a domain randomisation strategy 
([SynthSeg](https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSeg)) for domain-agnostic segmentation of brain MRI.

In addition to further explore domain randomisation techniques, I'm working on different projects 
including equivariant networks, registration of fetal MRI, 
unifying disjoint manual annotation databases to train unified segmentation models.
